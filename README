Novelys Antispam
***

This is a very simple antispam technique that uses honeypots to try detect bad bots.

In your main stylesheet add :

.n_a_s {
  position: absolute; left: -2000px;
}

Just add in your form :

<%= novelys_antispam_honeypots %>

Before creating/saving your model, add this in your controller :

if NovelysAntispam.valid?(params)
  # ...
end

This is really just the beginning, feel free to enhance !
